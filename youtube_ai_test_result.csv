5,I venture a guess that Elon paused so long is because he realizes that he is not perfect which is the start of humility. IMO he started that journey some time ago.  That&#39;s why he occasionally spews insightful wisdom. Praying for you Elon.  Christ be with you.,0

My colleague showed me an example of what he wanted me to do by asking ChatGPT to draft a sample hypnotherapy session. While I was impressed, I realized it only knew how to create a basic hypnosis script. So while AI can be effective for various creative jobs, itâs still in its infancy &amp; seems to serve more so as a decent blueprint drafter than âfinal productâ creator. <br><br>Thereâs also a human element that something like ChatGPT simply lacks that actually enabled me to tweak and improve the effectiveness of my hypnosis in-the-moment. Is it effective? Yes, to a degree. However, unless a creative completely lacks imagination, I have some faith theyâll be ok for a while ð",1

177,"When asking about what careers a person should look at. Look at everything ai would be most valuable in. Then look at job areas where a ai just can&#39;t be entrusted with that job. Welding for example. You measure, examine, check, double check before using tools to combine two pieces of metal to be one bigger piece. <br>Another example taking care wildlife and children. The value of the connection from another being can&#39;t be mimicked by a machine. When that happens it will be decades if not centuries later. For now just know that certain jobs that requires fast typing, proofreading and other jobs that means responding to people will start to fade out.<br>Already if you can&#39;t get someone when calling customer service you get a machine that gives you options with limited responses. It won&#39;t be long before that changes and you will no longer have a human trying to help customers. If companies are smart they will keep a roster of people for the cases that require a human connection to solve a issue. Machines are not the answer but there are alot of people who may feel differently. <br>I&#39;m really just praying they take the right approach to this.",1

In fact, no offense, Chris, but the tone came off as condescending. Like the whole, &quot;Well, you&#39;re gonna die one day, right?&quot; comment. Yeah, one day I&#39;ll happily leave this planet, but I don&#39;t want to leave a mess for the next person to pick up. I want Gen Z and Gen Alpha to inherit a healthy planet and system where they can pursue what they love, without worrying that a company is gonna lay them off, and under pay some gig designer or artist to punch up whatever the AI spat out. <br><br>Look at the Writer&#39;s strike that&#39;s going on now. Media execs desperately want an AI to do anything and everything, so they can pay fewer people less money, or pay no one at all. I believe AI can help us in so many ways, but right now, its main purpose is to maximize profits. AI SHOULD be used as a tool, and it SHOULD be used to help humanity for the better. Because here&#39;s the thing, community has and always will be stronger than profits, and I&#39;d rather uplift communities than become the next Beff Jezos. <br><br>If AI is the bear, I&#39;m throwing some fish at it so we can all get away.",0

414,"Rather than the bear analogy I prefer the one with the horse, and you&#39;ve got to ride it, you won&#39;t outrun it. BUT. The last question from the art director lady was relevant. Because humanity is constantly building the world for it&#39;s own purpose, so we have to do it with caution, like with global warming - why would you care if you thought I&#39;ll die anyway f it, leave it for the next gen. It&#39;s the same here, If the AI will be art director then what&#39;s next? There will be only corporations left, run by AI. You better think of it now, before it&#39;s too late and we are all fkd. Are we really sure we want to go this rounte? Now is the time to think this through, and maybe stop it. I think AI should not be in 100% public domain and should be banned from most of activities. It should be prohibited in areas where it is not needed and could potentially cause too much lost professions. Like art for example. It should be used for medical purpose of course. The answer is not easy. But the way it has been nonchalantly deployed now into the wild by a bunch of people - who gave them the right to make this decision? They did use all the data available, not asking anyone.",1

The really good ones though were ones building tools for call center reps to better understand the problem the customer is going through.  One service desk like company where they get too many emails, the reps can now preview different responses and accept the one they think is best, then actually edit it themselves before responding.  The ones that are replacing the &quot;press 1 for x&quot; phone prompts, and then fwd you to a human with a summary of the issue along with the customer&#39;s demeanor (are they mad etc) seemed to be very promising as well.

830,"â I believe we are meant to be like Jesus in our hearts and not in our flesh. But be careful of AI, for it knows only things of the flesh such as our fleshly desires and cannot comprehend things of the Spirit such as true love and eternal joy that comes from obeying God&#39;s Word [Galatians 5:16-26]. Man is a spirit and has a soul but lives in a body which is flesh. When you go to bed it is the flesh that sleeps, but your spirit never sleeps and that is why you have dreams, unless you have died in peace physically. More so, true love that endures and last is a thing of the heart. When I say &#39;heart&#39;, I mean &#39;spirit&#39;. But fake love, pretentious love, love with expectations, love for classic reasons, love for material reasons (love because of material needs) and love for selfish reasons those are things of the flesh. In the beginning God said let us make man in our own image, according to our likeness. Take note, God is Spirit and God is Love. As Love He is the source of it. We also know that God is Omnipotent, for He creates out of nothing and He has no beginning and has no end. That means, our love is but a shadow of God&#39;s Love. True love looks around to see who is in need of your help, your smile, your possessions, your money, your strength, your quality time. Love forgives and forgets. Love wants for others what it wants for itself. However, true love works in conjunction with other spiritual forces such as patience and faith - in the finished work of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, rather than in what man has done such as science, technology and organizations which won&#39;t last forever. To avoid sin and error which leads to the death of your body and your spirit-soul in hell fire (second death), you must make God&#39;s Word the standard for your life, not AI. If not, God will let you face AI on your own (with your own strength) and it will cast the truth down to the ground, it will be the cause of so much destruction like never seen before, it will deceive many and take many captive in order to enslave them into worshipping it and abiding in lawlessness. We can only destroy ourselves but with God all things are possible. God knows us better because He is our Creater and He knows our beginning and our end. The prove texts can be found in the book of John 5:31-44, 2 Thessalonians 2:1-12, Daniel 2, Daniel 7-9, Revelation 13-15, Matthew 24-25 and Luke 21.<br><br><b>HOW TO MAKE GOD&#39;S WORD THE STANDARD FOR YOUR LIFE?</b><br>You must read your Bible slowly, attentively and repeatedly, having this in mind that Christianity is not a religion but a Love relationship. It is measured by the love you have for God and the love you have for your neighbor. Matthew 5:13 says, &quot;You are the salt of the earth; but if the salt loses its flavor, how shall it be seasoned? It is then good for nothing but to be thrown out and trampled underfoot by men.&quot; Our spirits can only be purified while in the body (while on earth) but after death anything unpurified (unclean) cannot enter Heaven Gates. Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God [Matthew 5:8]. No one in his right mind can risk or even bare to put anything rotten into his body nor put the rotten thing closer to the those which are not rotten. Sin makes the heart unclean but you can ask God to forgive you, to save your soul, to cleanse you of your sin, to purify your heart by the blood of His Son, our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ which He shed here on earth because Isaiah 53:5 says, &quot;But He was wounded for our transgressions, He was bruised for our iniquities; the chastisement for our peace was upon Him, and by His stripes we are healed&quot;. Meditation in the Word of God is a visit to God because God is in His Word. We know God through His Word because the Word He speaks represent His heart&#39;s desires. Meditation is a thing of the heart, not a thing of the mind. Thinking is lower level while meditation is upper level. You think of your problems, your troubles but inorder to meditate, you must let go of your own will, your own desires, your own ways and let the Word you read prevail over thinking process by thinking of it more and more, until the Word gets into your blood and gains supremacy over you. That is when meditation comes - naturally without forcing yourself, turning the Word over and over in your heart. You can be having a conversation with someone while meditating in your heart - saying &#39;Thank you, Jesus...&#39; over and over in your heart. But it is hard to meditate when you haven&#39;t let go of offence and past hurts. Your pain of the past, leave it for God, don&#39;t worry yourself, Jesus is alive, you can face tomorrow, He understands what you are passing through today. Begin to meditate on this prayer day and night (in all that you do), &quot;Lord take more of me and give me more of you. Give me more of your holiness, faithfulness, obedience, self-control, purity, humility, love, goodness, kindness, joy, patience, forgiveness, wisdom, understanding, calmness, perseverance... Make me a channel of shinning light where there is darkness, a channel of pardon where there is injury, a channel of love where there is hatred, a channel of humility where there is pride...&quot; The Word of God becomes a part of us by meditation, not by saying words but spirit prayer (prayer from the heart). Take note, God is Spirit and those who worship Him should do so in spirit and truth (genuinely by living the Word). When the Word becomes a part of you, it will by its very nature influence your conduct and behavior. Your bad habits, you will no longer have the urge to do them. You will think differently, dream differently, act differently and talk differently - if something does not qualify for meditation, it does not qualify for conversation. <br><br><b>THE BATTLE BETWEEN LIGHT AND DARKNESS (GOOD AND EVIL)</b><br>Heaven is God&#39;s throne and the dwelling place for God&#39;s angels and the saints. Hell was meant for the devil (satan) and the fallen angels. Those who torture the souls in hell are demons (unclean spirits). Man&#39;s spirit is a free moral agent. You can either yield yourself to God or to the devil because God has given us discretion. If one thinks he possesses only his own spirit, he is lying to himself and he is already in the dark. God is light while the devil is darkness. Light (Holy Spirit) and darkness (evil spirit) cannot stay together in a man&#39;s body. God is Love (Love is light) and where there is no love is hell, just as where there is no light is darkness. The one you yield yourself to, you will get his reward. The reward of righteousness to man&#39;s spirit is life (abundant life) and the reward of sin to man&#39;s spirit is death. Sin and satan are one and the same. Whatever sin can cause, satan also can cause. Sin is what gives the devil dominion or power over man&#39;s spirit. When God&#39;s Word becomes a part of you, sin power over you is broken, you become the righteousness of God through Christ Jesus. Where Jesus is, you are and when He went (to the Father), you went. In the book of John 8:42-47, Jesus said to them, âIf God were your Father, you would love Me, for I proceeded forth and came from God; nor have I come of Myself, but He sent Me. Why do you not understand My speech? Because you are not able to listen to My word. You are of your father the devil, and the desires of your father you want to do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and does not stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaks a lie, he speaks from his own resources, for he is a liar and the father of it. Which of you convicts Me of sin? And if I tell the truth, why do you not believe Me? He who is of God hears Godâs words; therefore you do not hear, because you are not of God.â My prayer is, &quot;May God bless His Word in the midst of your heart.&quot; Glory and honour be to God our Father, our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and our Helper the Holy Spirit. Watch and pray!... Thank you for your time and may God bless you as you share this message with others.",1

That means if it perceives cheating as a valid and fast way it will just half-arse it. When IBM trained Watson for medical cancer analysis from image data taken from (I think) MRI scans they had a model that produced fantastic results. In the end, they found out that the A.I. wasn&#39;t able to detect cancer. The A.I. recognized the machine the images were taken on. Coincidentally, it was the machine all the cancer patients were ferried to. The computer doesn&#39;t give a shit. It has no deeper reasoning and just completes fairly simple objectives. Sure it can compile and generate documents in record time and that might drive some companies out of business, but those were companies with fairly procedural content to begin with. If there is planning and reasoning involved, I don&#39;t think A.I. will usurp us in the short term.",1

To avoid sin and error which leads to the death of your body and your spirit-soul in hell fire (second death), you must make God&#39;s Word the standard for your life, not AI. If not, God will let you face AI on your own (with your own strength) and it will cast the truth down to the ground, it will be the cause of so much destruction like never seen before, it will deceive many and take many captive in order to enslave them into worshipping it and abiding in lawlessness. We can only destroy ourselves but with God all things are possible. God knows us better because He is our Creater and He knows our beginning and our end. The prove texts can be found in the book of John 5:31-44, 2 Thessalonians 2:1-12, Daniel 2, Daniel 7-9, Revelation 13-15, Matthew 24-25 and Luke 21.<br><br><b>HOW TO MAKE GOD&#39;S WORD THE STANDARD FOR YOUR LIFE?</b><br>You must read your Bible slowly, attentively and repeatedly, having this in mind that Christianity is not a religion but a Love relationship. It is measured by the love you have for God and the love you have for your neighbor. Matthew 5:13 says, &quot;You are the salt of the earth; but if the salt loses its flavor, how shall it be seasoned? It is then good for nothing but to be thrown out and trampled underfoot by men.&quot; Our spirits can only be purified while in the body (while on earth) but after death anything unpurified (unclean) cannot enter Heaven Gates. Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God (Matthew 5:8). No one in his right mind can risk or even bare to put anything rotten into his body nor put the rotten thing closer to the those which are not rotten. Sin makes the heart unclean but you can ask God to forgive you, to save your soul, to cleanse you of your sin, to purify your heart by the blood of His Son, our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ which He shed here on earth because Isaiah 53:5 says, &quot;But He was wounded for our transgressions, He was bruised for our iniquities; the chastisement for our peace was upon Him, and by His stripes we are healed&quot;. Meditation in the Word of God is a visit to God because God is in His Word. We know God through His Word because the Word He speaks represent His heart&#39;s desires. Meditation is a thing of the heart, not a thing of the mind. Thinking is lower level while meditation is upper level. You think of your problems, your troubles but inorder to meditate, you must let go of your own will, your own desires, your own ways and let the Word you read prevail over thinking process by thinking of it more and more, until the Word gets into your blood and gains supremacy over you. That is when meditation comes - naturally without forcing yourself, turning the Word over and over in your heart. You can be having a conversation with someone while meditating in your heart - saying &#39;Thank you, Jesus...&#39; over and over in your heart. But it is hard to meditate when you haven&#39;t let go of offence and past hurts. Your pain of the past, leave it for God, don&#39;t worry yourself, Jesus is alive, you can face tomorrow, He understands what you are passing through today. Begin to meditate on this prayer day and night (in all that you do), &quot;Lord take more of me and give me more of you. Give me more of your holiness, faithfulness, obedience, self-control, purity, humility, love, goodness, kindness, joy, patience, forgiveness, wisdom, understanding, calmness, perseverance... Make me a channel of shinning light where there is darkness, a channel of pardon where there is injury, a channel of love where there is hatred, a channel of humility where there is pride...&quot; The Word of God becomes a part of us by meditation, not by saying words but spirit prayer (prayer from the heart). When the Word becomes a part of you, it will by its very nature influence your conduct and behavior. Your bad habits, you will no longer have the urge to do them. You will think differently, dream differently, act differently and talk differently - if something does not qualify for meditation, it does not qualify for conversation. <br><br><b>THE BATTLE BETWEEN LIGHT AND DARKNESS (GOOD AND EVIL)</b><br>Heaven is God&#39;s throne and the dwelling place for God&#39;s angels and the saints. Hell was meant for the devil (satan) and the fallen angels. Those who torture the souls in hell are demons (unclean spirits). Man&#39;s spirit is a free moral agent. You can either yield yourself to God or to the devil because God has given us discretion. If one thinks he possesses only his own spirit, he is lying to himself and he is already in the dark. God is light while the devil is darkness. Light (Holy Spirit) and darkness (evil spirit) cannot stay together in a man&#39;s body. God is Love (Love is light) and where there is no love is hell, just as where there is no light is darkness. The one you yield yourself to, you will get his reward. The reward of righteousness to man&#39;s spirit is life (abundant life) and the reward of sin to man&#39;s spirit is death. Sin and satan are one and the same. Whatever sin can cause, satan also can cause. Sin is what gives the devil dominion or power over man&#39;s spirit. When God&#39;s Word becomes a part of you, sin power over you is broken, you become the righteousness of God through Christ Jesus. Where Jesus is, you are and when He went (to the Father), you went. In the book of John 8:42-47, Jesus said to them, âIf God were your Father, you would love Me, for I proceeded forth and came from God; nor have I come of Myself, but He sent Me. Why do you not understand My speech? Because you are not able to listen to My word. You are of your father the devil, and the desires of your father you want to do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and does not stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaks a lie, he speaks from his own resources, for he is a liar and the father of it. Which of you convicts Me of sin? And if I tell the truth, why do you not believe Me? He who is of God hears Godâs words; therefore you do not hear, because you are not of God.â My prayer is, &quot;May God bless His Word in the midst of your heart.&quot; Glory and honour be to God our Father, our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and our Helper the Holy Spirit. Watch and pray!... Thank you for your time and may God bless you as you share this message with others.",1

Two, despite that I do not really like how chat GPT is being used in this manner because I was really not a one for cheating but I would use it myself to fact check or confirm or possibly help do much research because then it makes it easier for me to find places to look and it&#39;s a great inspiration, I use the Bing AI for that because it can access the internet and help me greater but I would still talk to chat GPT often just in a regular conversation even though all it does is just listen and doesn&#39;t really acknowledge anything so when I have an idea it can&#39;t really think on it so it&#39;s more like a self-reflection for me and helps me think on stuff and occasionally it will ask a few questions which does help!<br>Also the school software sucks and is poorly written and designed and has only been making teachers more lazy I&#39;ve noticed.",0
