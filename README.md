# NLP-Short-Text-Sentiment-Analysis

This is the repo for NLP Project on **Short Text Analysis for Sentiment Evaluation**\
The overarching framework of our project involves several key stages: 1) identifying and pre-processing
raw data, 2) developing an optimal model using machine learning algorithms for dataset classification, 3)
building a model based on BERT for dataset classification, and 4) evaluating and comparing the performance
and results derived from analyzing short, unstructured texts 5) adding features and visualizations for better
user interface and comprehensive understanding of sentiment analysis.
